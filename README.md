# [Curvature Warfare](https://gaxyhs.itch.io/curvature-warfare)

This game was a submission made for the **GeoJam 2022** in 48 hours with the theme **Pick a side**. The game also had to have a focus on geometric figures, which was followed by only using polygons for everything.
This was also my first attempt at a game jam.
